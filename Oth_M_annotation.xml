<!--Othello, commentary by Jessica Slights. Revised 2014-05-19-->

<note>
<ln tln="2"/>
<lem>Enter Roderigo and Iago.</lem>
<level n="2">
The Q texts list Iago's name before Roderigo's. Playing the entrances in this order could operate as an early sign of the dominance that Iago has over Roderigo throughout the play.
</level>
</note>

<note>
<ln tln="4"/>
<lem>Tush,</lem>
<level n="1">
Exclamation of impatience.
</level>

<note>
<ln tln="6"/>
<lem>this.</lem>
<level n="1">
I.e. Othello's marriage to Desdemona.
</level>
<level n="2">
The referent seems deliberately unclear, and it becomes obvious only later in the scene that the two men are discussing Othello's marriage to Desdemona.
</level>
</note>

<note>
<ln tln="7"/>
<lem>'Sblood,</lem>
<level n="1">
Contraction of "God's blood," a common oath.
</level>
</note>

<note>
<ln tln="8"/>
<lem>such a matter,</lem>
<level n="1">
Another vague reference to Othello's marriage.
</level>
</note>

<note>
<ln tln="10"/>
<lem>him</lem>
<level n="1">
I.e. Othello.
</level>
</note>

<note>
<ln tln="12"/>
<lem>great ones of the city,</lem>
<level n="1">
Influential citizens of Venice.
</level>
</note>

<note>
<ln tln="14"/>
<lem>Off-capped</lem>
<level n="1">
Removed their hats as a sign of respect.

<level n="2">
<i>OED</i> records this as the first occurrence of the word.
</level>
</note>

<note>
<ln tln="17-18"/>
<lem>bombast circumstance . . . war,</lem>
<level n="1">
Pompous circular talk full of military terminology. <i>Bombast</i> = inflated; overelaborate.
</level>
<level n="2">
See <i>OED</i> Bombast <i>adj.</i> 2.
</level>
</note>

<note>
<ln tln="19"/>
<lem>Non-suits my mediators.</lem>
<level n="1">
"Forces my supporters to withdraw their case."
</level>
<level n="2">
Iago uses legal jargon even as he argues that Othello relies too heavily on military jargon.
</level>
</note>

<note>
<ln tln="19"/>
<lem>"Certes,"</lem>
<level n="1">
Certainly.
</level>
</note>

<note>
<ln tln="21"/>
<lem>Forsooth,</lem>
<level n="1">
In truth.
</level>
</note>

<note>
<ln tln="21"/>
<lem>arithmetician,</lem>
<level n="1">
One who is good with numbers.
</level>
<level n="2">
Iago's complaint throughout this passage is that Cassio is a bean counter who deals in numbers rather than an experienced soldier versed in the realities of war.
</level>
</note>

<note>
<ln tln="22"/>
<lem>Florentine --</lem>
<level n="1">
Citizen of Florence.
</level>
<level n="2">
The emphasis here is on Cassio's foreignness; he is not Venetian. Honigmann notes that since Florence was the birthplace of Italian diplomat and political philosopher Machiavelli, <i>Florentine</i> became synonymous with "crafty devil." For a discussion of Machiavelli's controversial approach to government see <ilink component="slt" href="ideas/new knowledge/machiavelli.html">Machiavelli: monster or mastermind?</ilink>
</level>

<note>
<ln tln="23"/>
<lem>almost damned in a fair wife --</lem>
<level n="2">
This apparent non-sequitur has been linked to the Italian proverb <foreign lang = "Italian">L'hai tolta bella? Tuo danno</foreign> = "Have a beautiful wife? You're damned." However, this connection does little to clarify a line which seems to imply that Cassio is either married or on the brink of marriage when he appears to be single later in the play. Neill suggests that Iago may have picked up a rumor, started by Bianca, that Cassio plans to marry her, though it seems at least as likely that Iago is trying to start such gossip in an attempt to damage Cassio's reputation (see TLN 2502).

<lem>spinster,</lem>
<level n="1">
Woman who spins fibers into thread; unmarried woman.
</level>
<level n="2">

<lem>tongu{`e}d</lem>
<level n="1">
Having a tongue; i.e. talkative. Note that here and throughout <i>{`e}</i> indicates that the final <i>ed</i> must be pronounced in order for a line of verse to maintain its regular metrical pattern.
</level>
<level n="2">
Although he opts for <i>toga'd</i>, Neill points out that F's <i>tongued</i> enables a "chain of association" with both <i>spinster</i> (TLN 26) and <i>prattle</i> (TLN 28).
