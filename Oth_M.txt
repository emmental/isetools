<L n="10" /><TLN n="13" />In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
<L n="11" /><TLN n="14" />Off-capped to him -- and by the faith of man
<L n="12" /><TLN n="15" />I know my price; I am worth no worse a place --
<L n="13" /><TLN n="16" />But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,
<L n="14" /><TLN n="17" />Evades them with a bombast circumstance
<L n="15" /><TLN n="18" />Horribly stuffed with epithets of war,
<L n="16" /><TLN n="19" />Non-suits my mediators. For "Certes," says he,
<L n="17" /><TLN n="20" />"I have already chose my officer."
<L n="18" /><TLN n="20.1" />And what was he?
<L n="19" /><TLN n="21" />Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
<L n="20" /><TLN n="22" />One Michael Cassio, a Florentine --
<L n="21" /><TLN n="23" />A fellow almost damned in a fair wife --
<L n="22" /><TLN n="24" />That never set a squadron in the field,
<L n="23" /><TLN n="25" />Nor the division of a battle knows
<L n="24" /><TLN n="26" />More than a spinster, unless the bookish theoric
<L n="25" /><TLN n="27" />Wherein the tongu{`e}d consuls can propose
<L n="26" /><TLN n="28" />As masterly as he. Mere prattle without practise
<L n="27" /><TLN n="29" />Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th'election;
<L n="28" /><TLN n="30" />And I -- of whom his eyes had seen the proof
<L n="29" /><TLN n="31" />At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds,
<L n="30" /><TLN n="32" />Christened and heathen -- must be beleed and calmed
